Extended Keyboard (Tablet Side Client)
=========
This is the readme file of the tablet side client of Extended Keyboard.

With this app, you will be free from switching keyboard modes when typing on your tablet and holding down long long time to move the cursor. Just use the "spare" smartphone on your side!

Please download the APK file and remember to allow app installs from unknown sources in Settings before installation. This app requires Bluetooth access and the phone side client installed and running on another Bluetooth-enabled Android device (e.g., your smartphone).

Enjoy!
